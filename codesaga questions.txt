RULES

1.	The game has 3 levels with 5 questions each. 

2.	To clear current level & unlock next level, you need to answer the 5th question, which can be cracked using answers of first 4 questions.

3.	Aim is to crack the final destination which will be visible only after clearing all 3 levels.

4.	Clearing all the questions of one level will lead to a bonus question, which will give you a clue to the final destination.

5.	The team that cracks the final destination first will be the winner.

6.	Assume that all the necessary header files are included.
7.	While giving the answer to any question, input in lower caps only. 
8.	Time limit of game: 1 hour.
9.	Tie breaker: In case more than 1 team cracks the final destination in same duration then the winner will be the team with more number of correct answers.
